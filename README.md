# Thymeleaf-Spring-Data-JPA-Spring-Security
I built a Crud web app with Spring Boot. First of all, in this web app around managing patients, I used some Spring Boot dependencies such as : Spring Data JPA, H2 Database, Spring Web, Thymeleaf; Lombok and Spring Boot DevTools. Then, I secured this web app by Spring Security.
